# The Autistic Hivemind
Fine-tuning Large Language Models &amp; other AI with content made by autistic creators

Goal:
Finetune LLAMA 2 on a corpus of anoymously collected data from autistic contributors on /r/autism, /r/aspergers, Twitter, and other autistic forums.

Due to LLAMA 2's acceptable use limitations, this project will not directly implement autistic LLM finetuning in this repository. We believe in free speech and therefore will simply help organize and collect data from autistic creators. We will also share data in an anonymous way to protect contributors' privacy - Nostr could be an option. 

We'll also link instructions on how to finetune your own LLM with your data.
